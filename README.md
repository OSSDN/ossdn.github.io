# Open Source Sindhi Developers Network (OSSDN) Repository

This is a github pages repoistory that can be accessed at (http://ossdn.github.com). The repository will eventually list the Sindh and Sindhi Language related digital open-source and closed-source projects. I have noticed that there are quite a few active and inactive projects in this domain that need support and consolidation. We can bring these projects under one umbrella to provide a one-stop location for end-users, encourage adoption and discovery, encourage further development and improvement.

Please use pull request mechanism to submit any changes. Contact me if you need help using Github.com.
